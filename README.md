## Project overview

This project implements the models AB1, AB2, and AB3 as rooted graphs and
uses a generic BFS exploration to answer questions 4 and 5 of the assignment.

- **Question 4**: verification of mutual exclusion and deadlock properties
  by exhaustive state-space exploration.
- **Question 5**: construction of explicit counterexample traces
  (violation of mutual exclusion or deadlock).

The entry point is `main.py`.
